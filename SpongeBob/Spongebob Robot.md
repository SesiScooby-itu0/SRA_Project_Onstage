## For SpongeBob's robot, we integrated components from the LEGO Inventor 51515 kit along with motors from the LEGO Spike 45678 set. The system utilizes two color/light sensors: one dedicated to detecting colored squares on the competition mat, and the other configured for a P.I.D. (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) line-following algorithm. The P.I.D. controller is implemented to improve the robot’s stability and responsiveness while following a black line on the mat. The Proportional (P) term adjusts the motor speeds based on the robot’s current deviation from the center of the line. The Integral (I) term accounts for accumulated past errors, helping to eliminate small persistent deviations. The Derivative (D) term predicts future errors by measuring the rate of change, reducing overshooting and oscillations. This combination ensures smoother and more precise trajectory corrections, resulting in efficient and reliable navigation during autonomous runs. Locomotion is achieved through a differential drive setup powered by two motors. Additionally, two extra motors were implemented to control the robot's arms, enabling greater interactive dynamics with the audience and allowing it to grasp objects during the performance. <h2>
