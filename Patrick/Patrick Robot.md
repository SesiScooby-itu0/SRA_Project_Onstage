##For Patrick's robot, we integrated components from the LEGO Inventor 51515 kit along with motors from the LEGO Spike 45678 set. The system utilizes two color/light sensors: one dedicated to detecting colored squares on the competition mat, and the other configured for a P.I.D. line-following algorithm. Locomotion is achieved through a differential drive setup powered by two motors.<h2>
